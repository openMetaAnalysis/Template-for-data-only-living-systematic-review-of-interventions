A living systematic review

Short url: http://

**Clinical summary:** 
This meta-analysis suggests that the effectiveness of the clinical intervention *is* [moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-5-3-1). [Standarized mean differences](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-3) betweeen intervention and control groups across outcomes range from x to y. 

Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> '[might not be important](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at x% for all analyses; however very wide confidence intervals reflect the small number of studies and subjects. 

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) has not been done due to the small number of studies.

This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)
